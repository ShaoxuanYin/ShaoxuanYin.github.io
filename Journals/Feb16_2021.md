Recently, my lifestyle went disordered for the time schedule. And I'm tryna do something for compensation or redemption. That's an another story.

***

This year is my second sophomore year, and looking what I'm planning is the project about a _dmm_ skiing game(Skiing pose recognition based on `Openpose`). So I bought a Ubisoft game _Steep_ to experience the skiing. Well, I started to download and install the `Openpose` project.

What a mess! That's what I'm feeling, since my skills limitations. What I did really frastrates people like me.

1. clone the [`Openpose`](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) project. It's based on `Caffe` project, therefore you need to figure out a coffee(`Caffe`) first.

2. Next I clone the [`Caffe`](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git) and tryna install it by `Makefile`. After I finished `README` and batch files , several webs about how to configure it. (Snap!) All about "how Windows" and "how Ubuntu", nothing about _RED HAT_ distros. As I entered `neofetch` in terminal, I reassured that I'm just a _fedora33_ user, a nobody...
Till then, I realized that fight bare-handed against the dungeon dragon `Makefile` and `Makefile.config` is my only option. For real, lowering your expectaion does you peaceful.

3. The story background sickening people is I'm using latest developing tools to compile a bunch of codes which isn't perfect compatible cuz they're from generations ago. Pffft~ 

   Pitfulls in `Makefile.config`

   | 4                           | # CUSTOM_CXX := g++                                          | Uncomment it. I got `g++` why don't declare it?              |

My golden `fedora` got OpenBLAS, so revise them as below: `BLAS := open`  `BLAS_INCLUDE := /usr/include/openblas` (Depending on your own location. Not sure? search it) `BLAS_LIB := /usr/lib64`(Also) |
   | 安装boost_python库，.so文件 | Python configuration! They default use `python2.7` but I got `python3.9`. | 7.1 Comment `PYTHON_INCLUDE := /usr/include/python2.7 \` the whole line.<br>7.2 Uncomment `line 79,80` and research the correlated path like this`PYTHON_LIBRARIES := boost_python3 python3.9`<br>`/usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/core/include` |
   |                             | when you are `make` , ld -l cannot find some stuff.          | add`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib64":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to your `~./.bashrc`, the absolute path might be different. |

```config
# CUDA architecture setting: going with all of them.
# For CUDA < 6.0, comment the *_50 through *_61 lines for compatibility.
# For CUDA < 8.0, comment the *_60 and *_61 lines for compatibility.

CUDA_ARCH :=	-gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_30 \ 
		-gencode arch=compute_35,code=sm_35 \
		-gencode arch=compute_50,code=sm_50 \
		-gencode arch=compute_52,code=sm_52 \
		-gencode arch=compute_60,code=sm_60 \
		-gencode arch=compute_61,code=sm_61 \
		-gencode arch=compute_61,code=compute_61
```

just delete the corresponding one when the error `do not support arch=comput_xx` goes out.
