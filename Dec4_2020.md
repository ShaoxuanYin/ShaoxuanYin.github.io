#Log Friday; Frozen-windy but sunny
It's my first time to write the blog stuff like this.
Well~ Today's a tough day(Precisely, the entire week)

I fucked up my system again, again and again, etc. At the dawn of Nov. I purged the whole Windows10 system for a bundle of complex reasons:(1)Hung off the video games;(2)Pursuing a better(bug-less) system;(3)To try the most popular system within programmers and professional fellows, back end servers as well.

So I started my reinstallation journey--> Ubuntu20.04 at first 3 times, and Fedora33(Linus Torvalds also on this, that's cool!) this week since Monday and yesterday. You know why? Was I randomly deleted some important files? Yes, but why? Cuz I was trying to install the Nvidia Driver!

>* Download the driver.run file
>* go to account `log-in` for access the operating system
>* shut off the GUI and start to typing command lines
>* remove or blacklist the Linux build-in graphic driver `nouveau` and edit the `.conf` file to let the system know you blacklist it
>* `sudo bash ./<nvidia>.run` file
>* press **Enter** until I was hit by "Success" popping up(the tips&warnings on screen is crucial, DO NOT skip too fast)

Yeah, these are correct steps if a GNU/Linux wanna have Nvidia supports(which really easy to get fucked, like me)

I edited the `grub` file, `initmatrf`(Spelling right? If this one has any tiny error, you won't see the operating system normally startup besides a damn `busy box` or `grub` interface which could stuck you for hours/days).

I tried lots of command to straight out of that horror interface, although nothing worked but at least I had a experience like a hacker repair a obsolete full of confidentials computer. That's really a cool vibe for me.

Almost one month experience like this enhanced my ability to sniff the error or any other infomation printed on the screen of terminal. That's the most directly way to know what the program is doing when there's nothing updated on the GUI.

This sunday I'm required to code a program about "BFS&DFS of graph--Data Structure" in cpp lang. Tomorrow I'll work on that first, and this time I'll taste a 100% non-GUI coding flavor.

`w3m` and `chafa` using for web and pic access in terminal.

Peace~
