```c++
void graph::DFS(graph* myGraph){
      int j = 0;
     stack<int> buffer;
     buffer.push(0);
     myGraph[0].now = visited;
     cout<<buffer.top()<<" ";
     while(!buffer.empty()){
         for(j = 0; j < getTailSize(myGraph[buffer.top()]); ++j){
             if(myGraph[myGraph[buffer.top()].next[0][j]].now == visited){continue;}//if the Tail index corresponding vertex is visit    ed, skip it
             if(myGraph[myGraph[buffer.top()].next[0][j]].now == undiscovered){
                 buffer.push(myGraph[buffer.top()].next[0][j]);//otherwise it should be pushed into the stack and only push those lab    eled as "undiscovered", since "discovered" fellows are laying down in the stack.
                 //And after pushed a new vertex index at the top of the stack, which updates the top, "j" should be recounted as 0
                 j = 0;
                 //Meanwhile, update the status of that vertex as "discovered", cuz it cannot determine no any other branch for sure.
                 myGraph[buffer.top()].now = discovered;
                 cout << buffer.top() << " ";
             }
         }
         //When it goes the end of one DEEP route, the "for" loop would stop and execute the suites below                            
         //That you should pop it out
         buffer.pop();
     }
}
```
This "DFS"(which is wrong but has some marvelous effects) could traverse a tree from right to left
